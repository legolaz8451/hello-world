Hi everyone, if you're reading this you need to know that I'm learning Github and this text is part of a tutorial that I am reading. Having that clear, let's talk about myself. 

I'm a developer who likes JQuery, Java, Python among others programming languages. Now days I am in Germany.

That's all folks!
