# hello-world
Hi everyone, if you're reading this you need to know that I'm learning Github and this text is part of a tutorial that I am reading. Having that clear, let's talk about myself. 

I'm a developer who likes JQuery, Java, Python among others programming languages. I have experience in developing for about 7 years and yes, this is my first project in GitHub.

That's all folks!
